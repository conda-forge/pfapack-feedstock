  summary: Efficient numerical computation of the Pfaffian for dense and banded skew-symmetric matrices
  description: |
    Computing the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix is a problem that arises in various fields of physics.
    Both computing the Pfaffian and a related problem, computing the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix
    under unitary congruence, can be solved easily once the skew-symmetric matrix has been reduced to
    skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal
    form based on Gauss transformations, using a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm,
    or based on unitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens rotations,
    that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We also give a complete and fully
    optimized implementation of these algorithms in Python.
